npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
grunt serve
open localhost:3000

## Todo:

- replace template loading with precompilation and load with requirejs
- when making a company bankrupt, do you only want to select companies that are NOT already bankrupt?
- user input validation for form; currently open to xss and empty names
- use Underscore or highland; don't recreate the wheel

## Time Taken

2 hours, 6 minutes
