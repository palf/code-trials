# Sky Technical Test

Built on React; first time trying React. Spent half the time reading the doumentation...

## How to run

```
node server.js
```

## Nice things:

- ... ah well.

## Things to improve:

- No unit tests. No logic, really, just populating templates. Could write some for the few small utilities; decided not worth the investment. 2 hours is a short amount of time!
- Ugly output. Using Bootstrap for some styling; otherwise using default browser output. Again, a low priority investment.
- Using in-browser jsx renderer; should use precompilation. Easier to dev quickly without setting up watchman and livereload.

I'm feeling React was a mistake for an app of this size.
